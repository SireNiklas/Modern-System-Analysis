# CS 255 - System Analysis and Design Portfolio

## Project Overview
This course focused on system analysis and design using the DriverPass project. I worked on understanding client requirements and translating them into technical system designs, covering everything from business requirements to detailed system architecture.

## Documents Included
- **Business Requirements Document** - Analysis of DriverPass client needs and functional requirements
- **System Design Document** - Technical system architecture and design specifications

---

## Reflection on Course Projects

### **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DriverPass was a driving instruction company that wanted to create an online system to help students prepare for driving tests. The client, Liam (the owner), was frustrated that most driving schools weren't doing enough to help students actually pass their DMV tests on the first try.

They wanted a web-based system where students could take practice tests, schedule driving lessons with instructors, track their progress, and access study materials. The system also needed to handle different user types - students, instructors, and administrators - each with their own access levels and functionality. It was basically trying to bridge the gap between traditional driving schools and what students actually need to pass their tests.

### **What did you do particularly well?**

I think I did a good job breaking down the complex requirements into manageable pieces. When Liam described all the features he wanted, it was pretty overwhelming at first, but I managed to organize everything into clear functional and non-functional requirements.

The use cases were probably my strongest work. I was able to map out different user scenarios like "student takes practice test" and "instructor schedules lesson" in a way that made sense both technically and from the user's perspective. I also think I did well identifying the different types of users and what each one needed from the system.

### **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

Honestly, my system architecture diagrams could use work. I understand the concepts, but drawing clear, professional-looking diagrams is still challenging for me. Some of my UML diagrams were a bit messy and probably confusing to follow.

If I could redo them, I'd spend more time making sure the relationships between components are clearer and the layout is more organized. I'd also add more detail to show how data flows through the system instead of just showing what components exist.

### **How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**

I had to really listen to what Liam was saying about the problems his customers were facing. It wasn't just about building a website - he was trying to solve the real problem of students failing their driving tests because they weren't properly prepared.

I translated this into features like adaptive practice tests that focus on areas where students are struggling, progress tracking so instructors know where to focus lessons, and easy scheduling so students actually show up for their driving time. Each technical requirement had to connect back to a real user problem.

Considering user needs is crucial because you can build a technically perfect system that nobody wants to use. If the system doesn't solve actual problems or is too complicated for the intended users, it's basically useless no matter how well-coded it is.

### **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I'm still figuring this out, but I've learned that starting with the users and their goals is way more effective than starting with the technology. I tried to map out user journeys first, then figure out what the system needs to support those journeys.

For future projects, I want to get better at:
- **Requirements gathering** - asking better questions to understand what people actually need
- **Prototyping** - creating simple mockups before diving into detailed design
- **Iterative design** - getting feedback early instead of trying to perfect everything upfront
- **Documentation** - keeping track of design decisions so I remember why I made certain choices

I think the biggest lesson was that good system design is more about understanding problems than knowing specific technologies.
